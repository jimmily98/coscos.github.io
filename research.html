            The sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is crucial for 
            understanding complex systems, estimating parameters, or making predictions 
            in many fields ranging from statistics and machine learning to physics and 
            finance. In these scenarios, traditional analytical solutions become 
            impractical due to the complexity of the probability space, and sampling 
            provides a powerful alternative to gain insights. However, generating 
            representative samples from these high-dimensional distributions is 
            challenging, as the probability mass tends to concentrate in unexpected
             regions, making it hard to sample accurately.

        <p class="section-text">
            In lower dimensions, simple sampling strategies like importance sampling 
            may work well by drawing samples from an easier, known distribution and 
            reweighting them to approximate the target distribution. 
            However, in high dimensions, these approaches often fail due to the 
            "curse of dimensionality", by which basic sampling techniques 
            struggle to find representative samples in high-dimensional spaces.

                    The Monte Carlo (MC) method offers a robust solution to these 
                    high-dimensional sampling challenges. By building a chain of 
                    dependent samples that collectively approximate the target distribution,
                     MC methods can efficiently navigate high-dimensional spaces, 
                     even where standard sampling would fail. 
                     The iterative nature of MC methods enables them to focus on the 
                     regions of highest probability mass, ensuring efficient and reliable 
                     sampling in high dimensions.

            My one-year MSc program will focus on validating and evaluating 
            several state-of-the-art high-dimensional Monte Carlo sampling 
            strategies, with the goal of providing insights into the efficiency 
            of parallel Monte Carlo sampling methods in high-dimensional spaces.
